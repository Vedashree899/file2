1)Select the k no of neighbors
2)Calculate eucledian distance of k no of neighbors from the new data point
3)take the k nearest neighbors as per eucledian distance
4)among these k no of neighbors count the no of data points of each category
5)assign new datapoint to that category for which the count of no of neighbor is maximum
6)get output via model
